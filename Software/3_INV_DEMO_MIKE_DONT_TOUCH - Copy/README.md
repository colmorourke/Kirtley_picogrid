# 3 Inverter Demo
The code located in this folder uses older versions of CCS, Uniflash and Labview. These versions correspond to projects created on the picogrid laptop, which Po-Hsu used during his PhD.

- We've found that there's no difference for LabView and Uniflash - old code works on latest versions of these software. However, the CCS version does matter.
- List of old software versions that this code was created in:
  - Uniflash version ??
  - CCS version 6.2.0.00048
  - Labview 2016 version 16.0f2 (32-bit)


NOTE: For Documentation on how to run this project, please see README.md located in: Kirtley_picogrid\Software\3_INV_DEMO_MIKE_DONT_TOUCH_new_CCS - Copy
- Although there are slight differences between new and old versions of CCS & Uniflash, the overall procedure should be almost exactly the same.
