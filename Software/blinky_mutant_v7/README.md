# About BlinkyMutant_v7
- The goal of blinky mutant is to blink an LED on the Central controller via clicking a button on a LabView VI.
- Blinky Mutant is a modified version of Pohsu's Central Controller code.
- Originally, Matt Overlin & Colm were trying to modify the TI blinky example, to achieve our goal above.
- It proved to be easier, to simply modify Pohsu's code - the generation of blinky code created this way are now labelled "mutant".
