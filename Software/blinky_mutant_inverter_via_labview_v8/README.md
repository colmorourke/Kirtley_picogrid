# About blinky_mutant_v8
- The goal of this demo is to blink LEDS on all 3 inverter controllers (plus the Central Controller) via clicking buttons on the Labview GUI.
- This project demonstrates working RS485 & USB communication, along with basic peripherals such as the GPIOs.

## Central Controller Code
- This is basically the same as that of blinky_mutant_v7

## Inverter Controller code
- This is a modified version of Pohsu's Inverter Controller code.
- Original code is located at MIT-Pico-Grid/Software/New_MG/Firmware/Inverter_RS485.

# Labview code
- Nothing special. Pretty basic GUI.
